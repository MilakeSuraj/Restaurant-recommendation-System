## Model Architecture

- **Content-Based Filtering:** Matches restaurant attributes (cuisine, cost, rating) to user preferences.
- **Collaborative Filtering (SVD):** Learns from user ratings to suggest restaurants similar users enjoyed.
- **Hybrid Approach:** Merges both strategies for robust, personalized recommendations.
